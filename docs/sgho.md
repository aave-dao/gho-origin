# sGHO - Savings GHO Vault

## Overview

sGHO is an [EIP-4626](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) vault that allows users to earn yield on their GHO tokens. The vault automatically accrues and distributes yield to depositors through internal accounting, with all logic self-contained in the sGHO contract.

## Key Features

- **Full EIP-4626 Compliance**: Complete implementation of the ERC-4626 standard for tokenized vaults
- **Linear Yield Accrual**: Yield accrues at a fixed APR (simple interest, no compounding), tracked via a yield index
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permissions for yield management and emergency operations
- **Permit Support**: Gasless deposits using EIP-2612 permits
- **Supply Cap Management**: Configurable maximum vault capacity, set in whole GHO units (no decimals)

## Architecture

### Core Components

**sGHO.sol**: The main vault contract implementing:

- ERC-4626 vault functionality (deposit, withdraw, mint, redeem)
- ERC-20 token standard with permit support
- Automatic yield accrual via yield index mechanism
- Role-based access control using OpenZeppelin's AccessControl
- Pausability mechanism for emergency situations
- Emergency token rescue functionality

## Yield Mechanism

### How It Works

1. **Yield Index**: Tracks the accumulated value per share (in RAY precision, 1e27)
2. **Linear Accrual**: The index grows by `targetRate * timeElapsed` (simple interest at a fixed APR — it does not compound). It is only checkpointed to storage when the rate changes; in between, conversions read the live accrued value
3. **Share Conversion**: Asset/share conversions use the current yield index

### Key Parameters

- **Target Rate**: Fixed annual percentage rate (APR) in basis points (max 50% = 5000)
- **Yield Index**: Index used for share/asset conversions

## Role Management

- `PAUSE_GUARDIAN_ROLE` : This role has permissions to pause/unpause any action related to sGho shares including deposits, withdrawals and transfers.
- `TOKEN_RESCUER_ROLE` : This role has permissions to rescue tokens held on the contract
- `YIELD_MANAGER_ROLE` : This role has permissions to update the yield target rate and the supply cap.

## Security Considerations

### Built-in Protections

- **Supply Cap**: Limits maximum vault capacity
- **Rate Limits**: Maximum 50% annual rate to prevent excessive yield.
- **Balance Checks**: Withdrawals limited by actual GHO balance

### Important Limitations

- **First-Come-First-Served**: Withdrawals depend on available GHO balance of the contract
- **No Yield Buffer**: No explicit buffer for yield payments, so available yield is not guaranteed at any given time
- **DAO Dependency**: Relies on DAO to maintain adequate GHO balance based on the yield index

### Shortfall Risk

The vault operates on a first-come, first-served basis. If the contract's GHO balance falls below the theoretical total assets, some users may be unable to withdraw their full balance until additional GHO is provided.

## Math

sGHO uses high-precision arithmetic to ensure accurate yield calculations and prevent precision loss during share/asset conversions.
The following are key considerations for arithmetic precision in math operations:

- **Yield Index**: Stored with RAY precision (1e27) to maintain accuracy over long periods
- **Rate Calculations**: The annual rate is applied linearly, dividing by seconds-per-year last so a full APR period is exact
- **Share Conversions**: Asset-to-share and share-to-asset conversions use high-precision math
- **Accumulated Interest**: Linear interest accumulation calculated with RAY precision
